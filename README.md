# counterstrike

I originally made this in 2015 and haven't had to work on it since. With announcement of CS2, it
 was time to update and put it on git to preserve it.

## Installation

Right-Click CSGO\
--> 'Properties'\
--> 'Local Files'\
-->  Browse\
Should be in `...\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\` at this point\
Copy this repo contents into `steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg\csgo\cfg`

## Usage
